# WHIN-CSL

A python 3.5 implemention of WHIN-CSL proposed in paper "Citation Recommendation Based on Weighted Heterogeneous Information Network Containing Semantic Linking", ICME 2019 [paper](http://www.pdf-express.org/Conf/44524XP/versions/981188/PID5863305.pdf). The implementation is flexible enough for modifying the model or fit your own datasets.

Requirements: This package is developed with Python 3.5, please make sure all the demendencies are installed, which is specified in requirements.txt.

```
-ATTN: This package is free for academic usage. You can run it at your own risk. 
For other purposes, please contact Prof. Shu Zhao(zhaoshuzs2002@hotmail.com)
-ATTN2: This package was developed by Mr.Yang Liu(liuy_anhui@163.com). 
The readme file and demo roughly explains how to use the codes. For any problem concerning the codes, please feel free to contact Mr.Liu.
-ATTN3: This package was provided by Lab of Intelligent computing and knowledge engineering, School of computer science and technology, Anhui University
